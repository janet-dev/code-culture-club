Digital Culture Magazine
<br><br>
Ana, Janet, Kemer and Niamh - we are coders 
who have formed the 'code culture club' for our team project.
<br><br>
'code culture club' is a monthly online publication showcasing lesser known aspects of 
international culture. We will be writing about local talent, cuisine, travel and life.
<br><br>
This November (2020) issue will feature art and architecture from Ireland, fashion from Italy, 
modern history from Germany, food and history from Turkey.
