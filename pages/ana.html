              Italy is one of the leading countries in fashion design, alongside France, the United States and the United
              Kingdom. Fashion has always been an important part of the country's cultural life and society, and Italians
              are
              well known for their attention of dressing-up well; "la bella figura", or good impression, remains

          <div class="info">
              Italian fashion is linked to the most generalized concept of "Made in Italy", a merchandise brand expressing
              excellence of creativity and craftsmanship. Italian luxury goods are renowned for the quality of the
              textiles
              and the elegance and refinement of their construction. Many French, British and American high-top luxury
              brands
              (such as Chanel, Dior, Balmain and the main line of Ralph Lauren) also rely on Italian craft factories,
              located
              in highly specialized areas in the metropolitan area of Naples and in the centre-north of Italy (Tuscany,
              Marche, Veneto and Piedmont), to produce parts of their apparel and accessories.
